## Algorithm Analysis and Order Notation in Data Structures & Algorithms

### Algorithm Analysis

Algorithm analysis deals with quantifying the resource consumption of algorithms, such as:

* **Time Complexity:** Number of operations per input.
* **Space Complexity:** Memory usage during execution.


**Common Complexity Measures:**

* **Best Case:** Optimal performance under ideal conditions.
* **Worst Case:** Maximum performance under any input.
* **Average Case:** Overall performance averaged over all possible inputs.


### Order Notation

Order notation describes the asymptotic behavior of functions, focusing on how the function grows as input size increases. It highlights insignificant constants and focuses on the rate of growth in relation to the input size. 

**Common Order Notations:**

* **O(1):** Constant time complexity - independent of input size.
* **O(log n):** Logarithmic time complexity - growth rate is logarithmic.
* **O(n):** Linear time complexity - growth rate is directly proportional to input size.
* **O(n^2):** Quadratic time complexity - growth rate is proportional to the square of input size.


### Time Complexity Analysis

Time complexity involves tracking the number of operations performed by an algorithm for different input sizes. By analyzing the loop structure, recursion depth, and other control flow mechanisms, we can determine the time complexity of an algorithm.

**Example:** 

```
for i = 1 to n:
    for j = 1 to n:
        // O(n^2) time complexity due to nested loops
```


### Space Complexity Analysis

Space complexity measures the memory used by an algorithm during execution, including data structures and variables. It typically involves tracking memory allocation and deallocation patterns. 

**Example:**

```
array[0..n] = [1, 2, 3, ..., n];
// O(n) space complexity due to array allocation
```


### Applications of Complexity Analysis

* **Efficiency Optimization:** Identifying inefficient algorithms for optimization.
* **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing the best algorithm for a given problem based on its complexity.
* **Complexity Guarantees:** Proving that an algorithm meets performance requirements.
