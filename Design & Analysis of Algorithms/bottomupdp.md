## Bottom-Up Design (Dynamic Programming)

### Definition

Bottom-up design, also known as Dynamic Programming (DP), is a problem-solving approach in algorithm design where we break down a complex problem into smaller subproblems and solve them recursively. We store the results of the smaller subproblems in a table and reuse them in solving larger subproblems. 


### Characteristics

- **Recursive:** The solution to the large problem is composed of smaller subproblems.
- **Overlapping Subproblems:** Many of the smaller subproblems overlap each other.
- **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution to the large problem can be derived from the optimal solutions of its smaller subproblems.


### Advantages

- Efficient and reusable solutions due to caching of results.
- Suitable for optimization problems.
- Often leads to efficient and concise algorithms.


### Disadvantages

- Not suitable for all problems.
- Can be computationally expensive for large problems due to table storage.


### Steps for Bottom-Up Design

1. **Identify overlapping subproblems:** Determine if the problem can be decomposed into smaller subproblems that have common solutions.


2. **Define subproblems:** Precisely describe the smaller subproblems that contribute to the solution of the larger problem.


3. **Cache results:** Store the solutions to the smaller subproblems in a table.


4. **Iteratively solve subproblems:** Solve the smaller subproblems in a systematic order, caching the results in the table.


5. **Combine results:** Use the cached results of the smaller subproblems to solve the larger problem.


### Applications

**1. Matrix Chain Multiplication:** 
- Optimizes the order of multiplying matrices to minimize multiplications.


**2. Longest Common Subsequence:** 
- Finds the longest sequence of characters common to two strings.


**3. Fibonacci Numbers:** 
- Calculates Fibonacci numbers efficiently by caching the results of smaller subproblems.


**4. Optimal Binary Search Tree:** 
- Construct an optimal binary search tree from a given set of data.


### Examples

**1. Fibonacci Numbers:**

```
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n >= 2
```

**2. Matrix Chain Multiplication:**

```
M(i, j) = min(M(i, k) + M(k+1, j) + i * j * k) for i <= k <= j-1
```


### Conclusion

Bottom-up design is a powerful problem-solving technique in algorithm design and analysis. By leveraging overlapping subproblems and caching their results, we can efficiently obtain optimal solutions to a wide range of problems.
