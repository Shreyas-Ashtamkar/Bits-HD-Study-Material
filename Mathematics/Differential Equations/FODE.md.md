## First Order Differential Equations

First order differential equations (FODEs) are differential equations involving a dependent variable and its first derivative. They are widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.

**Structure of a First Order ODE:**

$$y’=f(x,y)$$

where:

* \(y\) is the dependent variable
* \(x\) is the independent variable
* \(f\) is a function of \(x\) and \(y\)

**Linear First Order ODEs:**

A linear FODE is one where \(f\) is a linear function of \(y\). 

$$y’+p(x)y=q(x)$$ 

where \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\) are functions of \(x\) only.

**Examples of Linear ODEs:**

* \(y’+2xy=0\)
* \(y’-x^2y=1\)

**Nonlinear First Order ODEs:** 

A nonlinear FODE is one where \(f\) is not a linear function of \(y\).

$$y’=f(y)g(x)$$

**Examples of Nonlinear ODEs:**

* \(y’=y^2\)
* \(y’=\sin(y)\)

**Solutions to FODEs:**

* **Separation of variables:** Suitable for linear and some nonlinear ODEs.
* **Exact equations:** Solved using specific conditions.
* **Integrating factors:** Used for non-linear ODEs.

**Applications of FODEs:**

FODEs have numerous applications, such as:

* Modeling the motion of objects under influence of forces.
* Describing population growth.
* Analyzing electrical circuits.
* Optimizing engineering processes.

**Solving Techniques:**

* Understand the type of ODE (linear/nonlinear)
* Choose the appropriate solving technique.
* Verify the solution.
* Interpret the solution in the context of the problem.

**Conclusion:**

First order differential equations play a significant role in various scientific and technological fields. Understanding and solving these equations is crucial for modeling and analyzing numerous phenomena.
