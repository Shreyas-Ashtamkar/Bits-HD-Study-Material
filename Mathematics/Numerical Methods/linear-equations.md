## Solution of System of Linear Equations in Numerical Methods

**Introduction:**

Solving systems of linear equations is a fundamental problem in Numerical Methods. Various iterative methods are employed to approximate the solution of such systems efficiently and accurately. These methods utilize mathematical techniques to find approximate solutions when the analytical solutions are unavailable or computationally impractical.

**Direct Methods:**

Direct methods involve solving the system of equations directly to obtain the solution. Gauss elimination and LU decomposition are two prominent direct methods for solving systems of linear equations.

**Gauss Elimination:**

- Involves transforming the system of equations into an equivalent triangular form.
- Triangular systems can be solved easily by back-substitution or forward substitution.


**LU Decomposition:**

- Decomposes the coefficient matrix into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U).
- The solution is then found by solving two triangular systems.


**Iterative Methods:**

Iterative methods are iterative in nature, meaning they repeat a specific process until the solution converges to a desired tolerance. Some notable iterative methods are:

**1. Jacobi Method:**
- Uses Gauss elimination to perform iterations.
- Suitable for diagonally dominant systems.


**2. Gauss-Seidel Method:**
- Improved version of Jacobi method.
- Suitable for non-diagonally dominant systems.


**3. Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR):**
- More efficient than the Gauss-Seidel method.
- Suitable for systems with large diagonal elements.


**4. Conjugate Gradient Method:**
- More robust and efficient than previous methods.
- Works best for systems with positive definite coefficient matrices.


**Factors Affecting Convergence:**

- **Condition number:** Ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue of the coefficient matrix.
- **Number of iterations:** The number of times the iterative method is repeated.
- **Tolerance:** The desired accuracy of the solution.


**Applications:**

Solving systems of linear equations has numerous applications in various fields:

- Engineering: Solving structural analysis, fluid dynamics, circuit analysis.
- Physics: Solving heat flow problems, wave propagation problems.
- Finance: Portfolio optimization, risk assessment.


**Conclusion:**

Solving systems of linear equations is a crucial aspect of numerical methods. Various direct and iterative methods are available to approximate the solution of such systems efficiently and effectively. Understanding these methods and their applications is vital for solving diverse mathematical and engineering problems.
