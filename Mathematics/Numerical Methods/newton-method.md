## Newton's Method for Solving Nonlinear Algebraic Equations

**Introduction:**

Newton's method is a powerful numerical method for finding roots (solutions) of nonlinear algebraic equations. It employs derivative information to rapidly and accurately locate roots. 

**Mathematical Formulation:**

$$x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$

Where:

* $x_n$ is the current approximation of the root
* $f(x_n)$ is the function evaluated at the current approximation
* $f'(x_n)$ is the derivative of the function evaluated at the current approximation

**Algorithm:**

1. Choose an initial guess $x_0$ of the root.
2. Calculate the derivative of the function.
3. Compute the next approximation using the formula.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence is achieved.

**Convergence:**

* Newton's method converges quadratically, meaning the error reduces by a factor of approximately four with each iteration.
* Convergence is guaranteed if the function is twice differentiable, the derivative is non-zero, and the initial guess is close enough to the root.

**Examples:**

**1) Solving the equation:**

$$x^2-2=0$$

With an initial guess of $x_0=1$, we get:

$$x_1 = 1 - \frac{1-2}{2} = 1.5$$

**2) Root of the cosine function:**

$$cos(x)=0$$

With an initial guess of $x_0=1$, we get:

$$x_1 = 1 - \frac{\cos(1)}{\sin(1)} = 0.732$$

**Factors Affecting Convergence:**

* Accuracy of the initial guess
* Derivative calculation accuracy
* Function differentiability
* Non-linearity of the function

**Applications:**

* Finding roots of polynomial equations
* Optimization problems
* Solving chemical equilibrium equations
* Finding intersection points between curves

**Advantages:**

* Fast convergence rate
* Highly accurate for smooth functions
* Provides derivative information

**Disadvantages:**

* Requires derivative calculation
* Convergence can be slow for non-smooth functions
* Can diverge if the initial guess is far from the root

**Conclusion:**

Newton's method is a powerful numerical method for solving nonlinear algebraic equations. Its quadratic convergence rate and accuracy make it a valuable tool for various applications in mathematics, science, and engineering.
