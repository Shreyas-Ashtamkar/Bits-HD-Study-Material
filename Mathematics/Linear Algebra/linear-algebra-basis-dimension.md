## Basis and Dimension in Linear Algebra

### Introduction

Linear algebra revolves around the study of vectors, spaces spanned by vectors, and the transformations between those spaces. A crucial aspect of linear algebra is the concept of a **basis**, which provides a fundamental framework for expressing and understanding vectors and spaces. 

### Basis

A **basis** is a collection of vectors that can be used to represent any vector in a given vector space. The vectors in a basis are linearly independent and span the entire space. 


**Properties of a Basis:**

- Linearly independent: No vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.
- Span the space: Every vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.


**Example:**

Consider the vector space R^2. The following are bases:

- Standard basis: {(1, 0), (0, 1)}
- Graded basis: {(1, 1), (1, -1)}

### Dimension

The **dimension** of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for that space. 


**Characteristic of Dimension:**

- Different bases can have different number of vectors, but the dimension of the space remains the same.
- A space with a basis of n vectors has a dimension of n.


**Example:**

- The dimension of R^2 is 2, as any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors.
- A vector space with zero vectors has dimension 0.

### Span

The **span** of a set of vectors is the space generated by those vectors. In other words, it is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. 


**Properties of Span:**

- The span of a set of vectors is a subspace of the larger space in which they reside.
- The span of a basis is the entire space.


**Example:**

- The span of the vectors (1, 0), (0, 1) is R^2.
- The span of an empty set is the trivial subspace containing only the zero vector.

### Conclusion

The concepts of basis and dimension are fundamental to linear algebra. They provide a way to represent and understand vectors and spaces concisely and efficiently. By manipulating bases, we can perform various operations in linear algebra, such as solving linear equations, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and understanding the geometry of vector spaces.
