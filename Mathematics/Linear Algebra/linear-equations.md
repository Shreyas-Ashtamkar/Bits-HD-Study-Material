## System of Linear Equations in Linear Algebra

### Definition

A system of linear equations consists of multiple linear equations involving the same set of variables. Each equation represents an equality of two linear expressions.

$$ \boxed{ a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b }$$

where:
- \(x_1\), \(x_2\), ..., \(x_n\) are the variables.
- \(a_1\), \(a_2\), ..., \(a_n\) are the coefficients.
- \(b\) is the constant term.


### Types

- **Homogeneous:** All constant terms are zero.
- **Non-homogeneous:** At least one constant term is non-zero.
- **Consistent:** The system has at least one solution.
- **Inconsistent:** The system has no solution.


### Solution

- **Graphical Method:** Visual representation of equations on a coordinate plane.
- **Elimination Method:** Eliminate variables by manipulating equations.
- **Substitution Method:** Solve one equation for a variable and substitute it into the others.


### Applications

Systems of linear equations have numerous applications in various fields, including:

- **Engineering:** Solving structural analysis, designing control systems.
- **Finance:** Portfolio analysis, solving financial models.
- **Physics:** Solving differential equations, modeling physical phenomena.
- **Computer science:** Solving linear programming problems.


### Examples

**1. Solving a System of Two Linear Equations:**

$$ 2x + y = 5$$$$ 
$$ 3x - y = 7 $$

**Solution:** Using the elimination method, we can eliminate the variable y by adding the two equations.

$$ 5x = 12 $$

**2. Solving a Homogeneous System of Equations:**

$$ 2x + y = 0 $$$$
$$ 3x - 2y = 0 $$

**Solution:** The solution is (0, 0), as any non-zero solution would violate the equations.


### Conclusion

System of linear equations is a fundamental concept in Linear Algebra, with diverse applications across numerous industries. Understanding and solving such systems is crucial for solving various mathematical and real-world problems.
