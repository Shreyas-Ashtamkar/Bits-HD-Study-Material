## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in Linear Algebra

### Introduction

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra that play a crucial role in understanding linear transformations and their effects on geometric spaces. They provide insights into the behavior of linear operators and have numerous applications in diverse fields, including physics, engineering, and computer science.


### Eigenvalues

An eigenvalue λ is a scalar value associated with a linear operator T that scales the vectors in its domain, preserving their direction. 
$$T(x) = λx$$ 

**Properties:**
- Eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the operator.
- The number of eigenvalues of a matrix is equal to its dimension.


### Eigenvectors

An eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue λ is a non-zero vector that remains unchanged in direction after applying the linear operator. 
$$T(x) = λx$$ 

**Properties:**
- Eigenvectors associated with different eigenvalues are linearly independent.
- The span of the eigenvectors is the entire domain of the operator.


### Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, we need to solve the characteristic equation:
$$det(A - λI) = 0$$

The solutions to this equation are the eigenvalues. 


### Applications

**1. Computer Vision:** Eigenfaces are used for facial recognition and expression recognition.
**2. Signal Processing:** Eigenvectors are used for signal compression and noise reduction.
**3. Data Analysis:** Principal component analysis (PCA) utilizes eigenvectors for dimensionality reduction.
**4. Physics:** Eigenvalues and eigenvectors arise in various physical phenomena, such as harmonic oscillators and wave propagation.


### Examples

**Matrix Example:**
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\ 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$

The eigenvalues are λ₁ = 2 and λ₂ = 3. 
The corresponding eigenvectors are (1, 0) and (0, 1), respectively.


**Geometric Example:**
Consider a rotation in the plane around the origin by 90 degrees. The eigenvalues are λ₁ = e^(iπ/2) and λ₂ = e^(-iπ/2). 
The eigenvectors are (1, i) and (1, -i).


### Conclusion

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are powerful mathematical tools that provide valuable insights into linear operators. Their diverse applications across disciplines highlight their significance in understanding linear transformations and manipulating geometric spaces.
