## Conditional Probability and Independence in Probability and Statistics

**Conditional Probability**

Conditional probability deals with the probability of an event occurring, given that another event has already occurred. It quantifies the relationship between two or more events, where the occurrence of one event is dependent on the occurrence of another. 

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

**Independent Events**

Two events are independent if the probability of one occurring is not affected by the occurrence or non-occurrence of the other. In other words, the occurrence of one event does not influence the probability of the other. 

$$P(AB) = P(A)P(B)$$

**Relationship between Conditional Probability and Independence**

If two events are independent, the conditional probability of one given the other is equal to the marginal probability of the individual events.

$$P(A|B) = P(A), \text{ if A and B are independent}$$

**Dependent Events** 

If two events are dependent, the probability of one occurring changes depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of the other. 

**Calculating Conditional Probability**

- Identify the joint probability of the two events.
- Find the marginal probability of the condition.
- Divide the joint probability by the marginal probability.

**Examples**

* **Rolling two dice:** The probability of rolling a 6 on the first die is 1/6. The probability of rolling a 6 on the second die is also 1/6. The probability of rolling a 6 on both dice is 1/36. The conditional probability of rolling a 6 on the second die, given that the first die rolled a 6, is 1/3.
* **Medical diagnosis:** The probability of having a particular disease is 1%. The probability of a positive test result for the disease is 99%. The conditional probability of having the disease given a positive test result is 99%.


**Applications of Conditional Probability**

- Disease diagnosis and treatment
- Fraud detection
- Quality control
- Risk assessment



**Conclusion**

Conditional probability and independence are fundamental concepts in probability theory that play a crucial role in understanding and quantifying the relationships between events. These concepts have numerous applications in various fields, aiding decision-making and risk assessment under uncertainty.
