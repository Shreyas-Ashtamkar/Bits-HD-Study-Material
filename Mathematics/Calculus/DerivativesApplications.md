## Applications of Derivatives in Mathematics

### 1. Optimization Theory

- Finding critical points of functions to determine maxima/minima.
- Calculating marginal revenue/cost/profit.
- Determining concavity of functions.


**Example:** Maximizing the area of a circle given its circumference constraint.


### 2. Approximation and Interpolation

- Finding approximations of functions using tangents.
- Using derivatives for numerical differentiation and interpolation. 
- Constructing linear regression models from data.


**Example:** Approximating the value of a function at a point using the tangent line.


### 3. Related Rates Problems

- Finding the rate of change of one variable in terms of another variable.
- Solving problems involving compound interest, marginal analysis, and optimization.


**Example:** Finding the rate of change of volume of a cylinder when its radius changes.


### 4. Extreme Value Problems

- Finding the maximum/minimum values of functions subject to constraints.
- Solving Lagrange multiplier problems.


**Example:** Finding the maximum/minimum of a function on a closed and bounded region.


### 5. Curve Fitting and Differentiation

- Estimating function parameters from data.
- Identifying polynomial functions given data points.


**Example:** Finding the best fitting line through a set of points in the plane.


### 6. Implicit Differentiation

- Differentiating equations that implicitly define a function.
- Finding the derivative of parametric equations.


**Example:** Finding the derivative of the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1.


### 7. Applications in Probability and Statistics

- Calculating probability densities.
