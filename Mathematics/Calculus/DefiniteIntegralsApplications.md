## Applications of Definite Integrals in Mathematics

### 1. Area Under a Curve

- Finding the area under a curve represents the integral of a function over a specific interval.
- Applications include finding areas enclosed by parabolic shapes, circular sectors, and other curved regions.


**Example:** Calculating the area of a circular disk with radius r:
$$\int_0^r x^2dx = \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^r = \frac{r^3}{3}$$



### 2. Volume of Revolution 

- Definite integrals can be used to find the volume generated by revolving a plane region around an axis.
- Applications include finding volumes of solids of revolution, such as spheres, cones, and cylinders.


**Example:** Finding the volume of a sphere of radius r:
$$\int_0^r (2\pi x)\sqrt{r^2-x^2}dx$$



### 3. Work Done

- Definite integrals can represent the work done in various situations, such as lifting an object or compressing/expanding a spring.
- The integrand represents the force applied over a distance.


**Example:** Calculating the work done in lifting a 10kg object from the ground to a height of 2m: 
$$\int_0^2 10g xdx = [5g x^2]_0^2 = 20g$$



### 4. Centroid

- Definite integrals can locate the centroid of a plane region, which represents the balance point of the region.
- This knowledge is crucial for engineering designs and solving various physics problems.


**Example:** Finding the centroid of a triangle:
$$\overline{x} = \frac{1}{3}\int_0^b x(b-x)dx$$



### 5. Moments of Inertia

- Moments of inertia quantify the distribution of mass within a rigid body.
- Definite integrals can be used to find these moments for various shapes, which is essential for understanding rotational dynamics and stability.


**Example:** Calculating the moment of inertia of a circle about its diameter:
$$\int_0^{\pi} r^2 \sin^2(x)dx$$



### Applications in Other Fields

Definite integrals find extensive applications in numerous fields, including:

- **Engineering:** Design optimization, stress analysis, fluid dynamics
- **Physics:** Energy calculations, momentum analysis, trajectory tracking
- **Finance:** Calculating portfolio risk, finding present values of investments
- **Manufacturing:** Quality control, process optimization, yield determination
