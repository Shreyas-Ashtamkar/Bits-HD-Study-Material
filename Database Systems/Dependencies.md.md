## Dependencies in Database Systems

**Introduction:**

Dependencies in database systems establish connections between attributes of multiple tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency. These relationships ensure accuracy and completeness of information stored in different tables. Different types of dependencies exist, each with specific characteristics and implications.


**Types of Data Dependencies:**

**1. Functional Dependencies (FDs):**

- Data in one attribute depends functionally on the values of other attributes.
- A determinant (attribute) determines the value of the dependent attribute(s).
- Example: Student ID functionally determines Name.


**2. Superkeys:**

- A set of attributes that can uniquely identify each record in a table.
- Superkeys guarantee no two records have the same set of values for the superkey attributes.
- Example: Combining Student ID and Course ID creates a superkey for the Students table.


**3. Candidate Keys:**

- A set of attributes that can uniquely identify each record, but not necessarily minimal.
- Every superkey is a candidate key, but not vice versa.
- Example: Name and Email are candidate keys for the Students table, but combining them creates a superkey.


**4. Primary Key:**

- The primary key is the chosen candidate key that is used to uniquely identify each record.
- It should be a minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record.
- Example: Student ID is the primary key for the Students table.


**5. Foreign Keys:**

- A foreign key is a referencing attribute in one table that points to a primary or candidate key in another table.
- Creates a connection between related records in different tables.
- Example: The Course ID in the Enrollments table is a foreign key referencing the Course ID in the Courses table.


**6. Multi-valued Dependencies:**

- One attribute can have multiple values for a single record.
- Example: A student can enroll in multiple courses.


**7. Transitive Dependencies:**

- If A depends functionally on B, and B depends functionally on C, then A depends transitively on C.
- Example: If Name depends on Student ID, and Student ID depends on Class ID, then Name depends transitively on Class ID.


**Conclusion:**

Dependencies are vital for data integrity in database systems. Understanding these relationships allows for efficient data modeling, constraint creation, and ensuring accurate and consistent data within a database.
