## Deadlock and Deadlock Handling in Operating Systems

### Deadlock Definition

Deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are permanently blocked, each waiting for a resource held by another, leading to a system standstill. Deadlock arises from:

- Mutual exclusion: Resources are held by processes in a way that prevents others from accessing them.
- Hold and wait: Processes hold resources while waiting to acquire additional resources.
- No preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from processes.
- Circular wait: Processes form a closed loop, each waiting for a resource held by the next in line.


### Types of Deadlock

- **System Deadlock:** Involves two or more processes holding resources while waiting for resources held by other processes.
- **Resource Deadlock:** Occurs when processes hold onto resources, preventing other processes from accessing them.
- **Object Deadlock:** Similar to resource deadlock, involves processes waiting for exclusive access to shared objects.


### Deadlock Handling Strategies

**1. Resource Allocation Table (RAT)**

- Maintains information about resource allocation and requests.
- Allows identification of processes holding and waiting for resources.


**2. Deadlock Detection Algorithm**

- Uses the RAT to detect if a deadlock exists.
- Identifies processes in a circular wait and resource configuration leading to deadlock.


**3. Deadlock Prevention**

- Limits resource allocation to prevent the possibility of circular wait.
- Ensures sufficient resources are available for allocation.


**4. Deadlock Avoidance**

- Employs resource allocation and request information to anticipate potential deadlocks.
- Allocate resources in a way that avoids circular wait situations.


**5. Deadlock Recovery**

- Identifies and terminates process or resource state leading to deadlock.
- Re-assigns resources or resumes processes in a safe state.


### Examples of Deadlock Handling

**1. Resource Allocation Table:** In a hospital setting, a nurse needs a syringe (resource) to administer medication (request) to a patient. Another nurse holds the syringe, waiting for a medication document (resource) to complete records (request).


**2. Deadlock Avoidance:** A manufacturing plant needs to order raw materials (resources) from multiple suppliers. To avoid deadlock, they prioritize suppliers and allocate orders based on supply availability.


**3. Deadlock Recovery:** In a transportation system, if multiple vehicles are stuck in a circular route due to road closures (resources), the system can abort one or more vehicles to free up the road and restore traffic flow.


### Conclusion

Deadlock is a serious issue in operating systems that can lead to system paralysis. By implementing appropriate deadlock handling mechanisms, operating systems can prevent, detect, and recover from deadlock situations efficiently, ensuring system stability and performance.
