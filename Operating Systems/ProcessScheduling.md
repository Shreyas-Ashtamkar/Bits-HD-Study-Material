## Process Scheduling

**Introduction**

Process scheduling is a crucial component of operating systems that deals with the allocation of CPU resources among multiple processes. It involves selecting a process from a pool of ready processes and assigning it to the CPU for execution. This process ensures that processes are executed efficiently and effectively, preventing any one process from monopolizing the CPU.

**Types of Process Scheduling**

* **Batch Scheduling:** Processes are submitted as a group and scheduled at a later time.
* **Job Scheduling:** Processes are scheduled for long-term allocation to minimize waiting time.
* **Short-Term Scheduling:** Determines which process to assign the CPU to the next.
* **Long-Term Scheduling:** Determines which processes remain in the job pool.


**Short-Term Scheduling Algorithms**

**1. First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)**
- Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.
- Suitable for short processes and provides fairness.


**2. Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- Schedules processes based on their estimated execution time.
- More complex to implement and requires process size information.


**3. Priority Scheduling**
- Processes are assigned priority levels.
- High-priority processes are scheduled before low-priority processes.


**4. Round-Robin (RR)**
- Allocates the CPU time quantum to each process in a circular fashion.
- Ensures fairness and prevents starvation.


**Factors Considered During Scheduling**

* Process priority
* Execution time
* I/O requirements
* Memory requirements


**Process Scheduling in Multiprocessor Systems**

In multiprocessor systems, additional factors are considered during scheduling:

* Processor utilization
* Load balancing
* Inter-process communication


**Consequences of Poor Scheduling**

* Inefficient resource utilization
* Increased waiting time for processes
* Reduced throughput
* Unfair process execution


**Tools for Process Scheduling**

* System calls
* Scheduling algorithms
* Monitoring and feedback mechanisms


**Conclusion**

Process scheduling is a fundamental aspect of operating systems, playing a vital role in ensuring efficient CPU utilization and fairness in process execution. By carefully implementing scheduling algorithms and considering relevant factors, operating systems can optimize system performance and improve process turnaround time.
