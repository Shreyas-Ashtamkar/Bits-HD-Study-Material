## **De-Multiplexers in Digital Electronics and Microprocessors**

**Introduction:**

A multiplexer (mux) is a device that selects one of several input signals and forwards it to a single output. Conversely, a demultiplexer (demux) does the reverse, splitting a single input signal into several output signals. These devices are fundamental building blocks in digital electronics and microprocessors.


**Demultiplexers (Demux)**

A demultiplexer with N input lines and 2^N output lines is called an N:1 demultiplexer. 

**Working:**

- A demultiplexer has two sets of inputs: data inputs (D0-D7) and address inputs (A0-A3).
- The address inputs select one of the 2^N output lines.
- When the address inputs are binary '000' to '111', the corresponding data input is connected to the output.


**Applications of Demultiplexers:**

- Selecting data from multiple sources to a single destination.
- Routing signals from various peripherals to a central processing unit.
- Implementing address decoders.


**Multiplexers (Mux)**

A multiplexer with N output lines and 2^N input lines is called an N:1 multiplexer.


**Working:**

- A multiplexer has two sets of inputs: data inputs (D0-D7) and address inputs (A0-A3).
- The address inputs select one of the 2^N input lines.
- The selected input is then connected to the output line.


**Applications of Multiplexers:**

- Combining data from multiple sources into a single channel.
- Reducing the number of input lines to a device.
- Implementing data compressors.


**Difference Between Multiplexer and Demultiplexer:**

| Feature | Multiplexer | Demultiplexer |
|---|---|---|
| Direction | One input to multiple outputs | Multiple inputs to one output |
| Functionality | Combines signals | Selects one signal |


**Conclusion:**

Demultiplexers and multiplexers are essential components in digital electronics and microprocessors. They enable efficient data handling by multiplexing and demultiplexing signals, reducing hardware complexity and improving performance.
